## Overview
### Description
An app where you can create excercising routines and share them, you can see other users' routines and like them or save them for you to use them later. You can visit other user's profiles if you liked its routines and follow them for you to know when it posts another routine.
Also, a routine can be set to be done from home, in a park or in a gym, so you can be recommended the nearest place for you to do it or look for them in the map.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health, lifestyle and fitness.
- **Mobile:** Excercising is something you don't do next to a laptop or desktop computer, but next to your phone, so making it a mobile app is a key aspect to make it practical and useful. Users could access their live location to search for gyms and parks to workout, also, they could be shown videos from the app to see how to correctly do the excercises.
- **Story:** Helping people get into excercise and workout is very positive for all users, a lot of people want to stay in form, but they don't know what excercises are best or how to mix them into a routine and are shy to ask, so a platform to make that easy can avoid people from quitting and go back to unhealthy habits.
- **Market:** Every person who has an interest in excercise and workouts, the target group is young adults who want to add excercising habits to their routine.
- **Habit:** It can become part of the users' daily routine, as they could spend some time searching for routines to do everyday or look at their saved ones.
- **Scope:** An efficient design for the routine builder might be a challenge, as well as creating the correct database design. There are a lot of nice-to-have features, but the core feature that is the routine builder is the main attractive of the project.
